= Recommendations Dataset Embeddings
:url: https://data.neo4j.com/rec-embed/

These are embeddings for the link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations[Neo4j recommendations dataset^]. 

The embeddings and vector indexes allow you to find semantically similar bios, plots, and posters.

== Get Started

=== Create recommendations database

To load the embeddings you will need to create a Neo4j database with the recommendations dataset.

You can create a new Sandbox instance by logging into the link:https://sandbox.neo4j.com/[sandbox.neo4j.com^] and selecting "Recommendations".

You can restore the dataset in your own database using the
link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations/blob/main/data/recommendations-50.dump[recommendations-50.dump] file.

=== Load the embeddings

To load *all* the embeddings, download and run the link:{url}load_all.cypher[`load_all.cypher`^] query.

See below for the individual embeddings and partial datasets.

== Embeddings

The embeddings were created for the properties using the following models:

- `Person.bio` - OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 
- `Movie.plot` - OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 
- `Movie.poster` - OpenAI CLIP

There are full embedding and a sample of the embeddings for the first 1000 (1k) nodes in the dataset.

There are also Cypher queries to load the embeddings and create the indexes.

The Python code to generate the embeddings is in the `src` directory.

All files are at link:{url}[data.neo4j.com/rec-embed^].
